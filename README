What
====

A Linux kernel-level library to access a Redis (http://redis.io) server.
We needed to have a kernel module do direct access to a key-value store,
and since our key-value store was Redis, we ported Antirez's hiredis
code (https://github.com/antirez/hiredis) to the kernel.

How
===

You should be able to use the client in your Linux kernel modules and
programs the same way you would use hiredis in userspace applications.
To build this in a loadable module, just include the redisclient.o,
sds.o and networking_utils.o in your mod-objs Makefile target. 

I've also adapted hiredis's test.c (see testredis.c); see the included
makefile to get a simple loadable module that will test redis
functionality upon loading (make sure to set your server IP / port in
testredis.c before building!)


Compatibility
=============

This has been tested on Linux kernel 2.6.22-14 and Redis server versions
2.0.0 and 2.2.0. 

License
=======

Released under the same terms (GPLv2) as hiredis.
